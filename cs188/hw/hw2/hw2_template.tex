\textbf{INSTRUCTIONS}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Due:} Monday, February 10th, 2014 11:59 PM
\item \textbf{Policy:} Can be solved in groups (acknowledge collaborators) but must
be written up individually. However,
we strongly encourage you to first work alone for about 30 minutes total in order to simulate an exam environment.  Late homework
will not be accepted.
\item \textbf{Format:}  Submit the answer sheet pdf containing your answers. Page 1
must be this page, with your name,
SID, and pandagrader email filled in. Page 2 must contain your answers
to question 1 part a. Page 3 must contain your answers to question 1 part b. Page 4 must contain your answers to question 1 part c.
You should solve the questions on this handout (either through a pdf annotator, or by printing, then scanning; we recommend the latter to match exam setting). Alternatively, you can typeset a pdf on your own that has answers appearing in the same space (check edx/piazza for latex templating files and instructions).
\textbf{Make sure that your answers (typed or handwritten) are within the
dedicated regions for each question/part.  If you do not follow this format, we may deduct points.}

\item \textbf{How to submit:}  Go to www.pandagrader.com. Log in and click on the
class CS188 Spring 2014. Click
on the submission titled Written HW 2 and upload your pdf containing your answers. If this is your first time using
pandagrader, you will have to set your password before logging in the
first time.  To do so, click on "Forgot your password" on the login
page, and enter your email address on file with the registrar's office
(usually your @berkeley.edu email address). You will then receive an
email with a link to reset your password.
