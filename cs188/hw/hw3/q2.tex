\begin{problem}[12]{Utilities}

Pacman is buying a raffle ticket from the ghost raffle ticket vendor.
There are two ticket types: $A$ and $B$, but there are multiple specific tickets of each type.  Pacman picks a ticket type, but the ghost will then choose which specific ticket Pacman will receive.  Pacman's utility for a given raffle ticket is equal to the utility of the lottery of outcomes for that raffle ticket. For example, ticket $R_{A,2}$ corresponds to a lottery with equal chances of yielding 10 and 0, and so $U(R_{A,2}) = U([\frac{1}{2}, 10; \frac{1}{2}, 0])$. Pacman, being a rational agent, wants to maximize his expected utility, but the ghost may have other goals! The outcomes are illustrated below.

Imagine that Pacman's utility for money is $U(m) = m$.

What are the utilities to Pacman of each raffle ticket?\\

Which raffle ticket will Pacman receive under optimal play if the ghost is trying to minimize Pacman's utility (and Pacman knows the ghost is doing so)? (circle one)\\

What is the equivalent monetary value of raffle ticket $R_{B,1}$?\\

\begin{question}[5]{}
Now imagine that Pacman's utility for money is given by $U(m) = m^2$. 
\begin{subquestion}[2]
What are the utilities to Pacman of each raffle ticket?\\
\vspace{.2cm}
{\centering $U(R_{A, 1}) =$ \solution{}{\TwoBiUAOne} \hspace{6cm} $U(R_{A, 2}) =$ \solution{}{\TwoBiUATwo}}\\

\begin{subquestion}[1]
The ghost is still trying to minimize Pacman's utility, but the ghost mistakenly thinks that Pacman's utility is given my $U(m) = m$, and Pacman is aware of this flaw in the ghost's model.  Which raffle ticket will Pacman receive? (circle one)\\

\begin{subquestion}[2]
What is the equivalent monetary value of raffle ticket $R_{B,1}$?\\

\begin{question}[2]{}
Pacman has the raffle with distribution [0.5, \$100; 0.5, \$0]. A ghost insurance dealer offers Pacman an insurance policy where Pacman will get \$100 regardless of what the outcome of the ticket is. If Pacman's utility for money is $U(m) = \sqrt{m}$, what is the maximum amount of money Pacman would pay for this insurance? \\
