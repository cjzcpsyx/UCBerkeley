Part I step 4 is the actually took me alot of time. The reason is because the tutorials about creating an axis with d3 js mainly focus on the call(axis) part and its options, but I really had a hard time to put the axis in the right position since I call(axis) right in my svg tag. However, later I find out I need to add another group and translate to put an axis to  a right position. The steps I took during development is: read the spec of PA1, read the turorial provided, search for examples on youtude(actaully it is really helpful), also general search on google.

I find out that a good way to test PA1 is to use the chrome build in debugger tool. When my programm does not work as expected(or the result is not correct accoring to the sample), I set a few breakpoints using debugger and print out userful infomations(mostly local variables) to console and find the problem. For example, when I debugg for svg axis, first I inspect the elment to figure out if the axis is really there but not displayed because position is wrong. Then, I found out actually the axis was not created into the svg canvas. So I print out the axis I created and found out actually the usage of axis was wrong. So goes for the search and fix it.
